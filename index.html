    <!-- WHY YOU NEED ME -->
    <section>
      <h2>Why You Need This Role</h2>

      <p>
        If you care about the quality of your work, you already know that excellence is not created
        at the top — it is built in the fundamentals.
      </p>

      <p>
        The way clients are onboarded, how communication is handled, how documentation is prepared,
        how follow-ups are done, and how expectations are managed all shape how your business is perceived.
      </p>

      <div class="highlight">
        <p>
          A sense of luxury and professionalism starts when the basics are done exceptionally well.
        </p>
      </div>

      <p>
        Clear internal and external communication builds trust. Trust enables better collaboration,
        stronger client relationships, and long-term partnerships. Over time, this leads to referrals
        and establishes your business as one that is truly <em>worth it</em>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Most founders understand this — but do not have the time or operational bandwidth to execute
        it consistently while also delivering core work.
      </p>

      <p>
        That gap between intention and execution is where I come in.
      </p>

    <!-- WHY ME -->
    <section>
      <h2>Why I’m a Strong Fit</h2>

      <p><strong>Founder & Operator:</strong> Precious</p>

      <p>
        I have over two years of experience supporting business owners and teams through client onboarding,
        project coordination, and operational execution.
      </p>

      <p>
        I am highly organized, process-oriented, and experienced in remote collaboration across multiple
        regions. I work closely with founders, internal teams, and external clients to ensure clarity,
        consistency, and high standards at every touchpoint.
      </p>

        <li>Client onboarding & ongoing support</li>
        <li>Operational workflow design & execution</li>
        <li>Project coordination and follow-through</li>
        <li>Internal & external communication alignment</li>
        <li>Documentation, reporting & process clarity</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        I work best with companies that value quality, reputation, and long-term relationships
        over short-term growth at any cost.

        If this resonates with how you want your business to feel and be perceived,
        the best next step is a short conversation.
