    <!-- WHY -->
    <section>
      <h2>Why This Role Matters</h2>

      <p class="lead">
        Companies known for quality are built through consistency at the foundational level — not speed alone.
      </p>

      <p>
        Client onboarding, communication, documentation, follow-ups, and internal handovers
        are not background tasks — they are the systems that build trust and reputation.
      </p>

      <div class="highlight">
        <strong>
          The perception of quality and even luxury begins when the basics are handled exceptionally well.
        </strong>
      </div>

      <p>
        Clear internal and external communication establishes trust, which leads to stronger collaboration,
        better client relationships, and referrals. Over time, this positions your business as genuinely worth working with.
      </p>

      <p>
        Most founders understand this — but often lack the time to execute consistently. That is where I step in.
      </p>

    <!-- ABOUT -->
    <section>
      <h2>Why I’m a Strong Fit</h2>

      <p class="lead">
        I support founders and teams who care deeply about how their business is perceived.
      </p>

      <p>
        I have over two years of experience supporting business owners through client onboarding,
        project coordination, and operational execution. I have worked directly with companies like
        <strong>EdX</strong> and <strong>2U</strong>, ensuring high standards at every client touchpoint.
      </p>

      <p>
        I have also spoken at industry conferences and hold a <strong>Credly Facilitator Badge</strong>,
        reflecting my commitment to operational excellence and education.
      </p>

      <p>
        In addition, I maintain a professional LinkedIn network of over 1,000 engaged followers,
        which I can leverage to share content promoting your company’s focus on quality, if desired.
      </p>

      <ul class="clean-list">
        <li>Client onboarding & ongoing support</li>
        <li>Operational workflow coordination</li>
        <li>Internal & external communication alignment</li>
        <li>Documentation and process clarity</li>
        <li>Remote collaboration across regions</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        I work best with companies that value reputation, trust, and long-term relationships
        over growth at any cost.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- NOT FOR -->
    <section>
      <h2>Who This Is Not For</h2>

      <ul class="clean-list">
        <li>Teams optimizing purely for speed or volume</li>
        <li>Founders looking for shortcuts instead of strong foundations</li>
        <li>Businesses that do not value clear communication and operational standards</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Let’s Connect</h2>

      <p class="lead">
        If your company values quality over shortcuts, the next step is a brief conversation.
        Message me on WhatsApp with your company name and a short description of your needs.
