    <!-- WHY -->
    <section>
      <h2>Why This Role Matters</h2>

      <p class="lead">
        Companies known for quality are built through consistency at the foundational level — not speed alone.
      </p>

      <p>
        Client onboarding, communication, documentation, follow-ups, and internal handovers
        are not background tasks — they are the systems that build trust and reputation.
      </p>

      <div class="highlight">
        <strong>
          The perception of quality and even luxury begins when the basics are handled exceptionally well.
        </strong>
      </div>

      <p>
        When communication is clear internally and externally, trust is established.
        Trust enables better collaboration, stronger client relationships, and referrals.
        Over time, this positions your business as one that is genuinely worth working with.
      </p>

      <p>
        Most founders understand this — but often lack the time to execute consistently. That is where I step in.
      </p>

    <!-- ABOUT -->
    <section>
      <h2>Why I’m a Strong Fit</h2>

      <p class="lead">
        I support founders and teams who care deeply about how their business is perceived.
      </p>

      <p>
        I have over two years of experience supporting business owners through client onboarding,
        project coordination, and operational execution. I have worked directly with companies like
        <strong>EdX</strong> and <strong>2U</strong>, ensuring high standards at every client touchpoint.
      </p>

      <p>
        I have also spoken at industry conferences and hold a <strong>Credly Facilitator Badge</strong>,
        reflecting my commitment to operational excellence and education.
      </p>

      <ul class="clean-list">
        <li>Client onboarding & ongoing support</li>
        <li>Operational workflow coordination</li>
        <li>Internal & external communication alignment</li>
        <li>Documentation and process clarity</li>
        <li>Remote collaboration across regions</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        I work best with companies that value reputation, trust, and long-term relationships
        over growth at any cost.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- NOT FOR -->
    <section>
      <h2>Who This Is Not For</h2>

      <ul class="clean-list">
        <li>Teams optimizing purely for speed or volume</li>
        <li>Founders looking for shortcuts instead of strong foundations</li>
        <li>Businesses that do not value clear communication and standards</li>
      </ul>
